7-ZipFar 4.65 Alternative
-------------------------------------------
7-ZipFar Alternative is based on original 7-ZipFar by
Igor Pavlov, http://www.7-zip.org


Differences from orginal 7-ZipFar
---------------------------------
I was disappointed with the fact, that 7-ZipFar tries to open all
files, when you press Enter. It may take a long time for plugin
to realize, that file is not archive, and to open it in normal way.
So I added ability to work with file masks.
I hope it's not the last addition to plugin, and people
will continue it's development.

How to use it?
--------------
Install plugin in FAR. (Copy files to Plugins\7-Zip folder)
Copy 7z.dll from 7-Zip distributive to plugin folder (or to PATH folder).
Configure plugin if you want.
Actually, you don't need 7-Zip archiver itself.
