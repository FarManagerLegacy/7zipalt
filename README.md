# 7-Zip Alternative plugin for [Far Manager](http://farmanager.com/)
This plugin requires 7z.dll. Either install [7-Zip](http://7-zip.org/) or place 7z.dll into plugin directory. Another option is to use installer which includes 7z.dll. Check out plugin settings to ensure that 7z.dll is found and its version is correct (9.x is recommended).

Differences from original 7-Zip plugin:

* Supports Far 2 and Far x64.
* Opens only files matching a list of file masks.
* Saves plugin panel mode and sorting order.
* Allocates disk space to avoid file fragmentation when extracting archives.
* Specific archive formats can be disabled (PE for example).
* Archive format can be selected manually.
* Other minor improvements.
